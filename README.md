I made this project using HTML, Javascript and CSS. It can be launched in a browser window but is not yet deployed as a webpage.

It relies on an external API that provides a deck of cards that is randomly shuffled. Once the deck is provided the game continues until either the player or the dealer wins. 

The project was a great excercise in hard coding the logic and rules of the seemingly simple game of Black Jack. I tried to make it as simple and clean as possible. 

I've left comments in the script.JS file to explain the logic of each function and variable.
