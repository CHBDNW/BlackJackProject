I made this project using HTML, Javascript and CSS. It can be launched in a browser window but is not deployed as a webpage as of yet.
It relies on an external API that provides a deck of cards that is randomly shuffled. Once the deck is provided the game continues until either the player or the dealer wins. 
The project was a great excercise in hard coding the logic and rules of the seemingly simple game of Black Jack. I tried to make it as simple and clean as possible. 
I've left comments in the JS file to explain the logic of each function and variable.
